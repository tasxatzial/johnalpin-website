        <h2 class="double-hr"><span class="between-lines">Childhood</span></h2>
        <p>I was born on June 28, 1971, in Seattle, Washington. During my childhood, i was an avid reader.
          At the age of 10, i developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20. I taught myself computer
          programming at the age of 10, and by the age of 12 i sold the code of a Fortran-based video game i created
          called Starblast, to a magazine called PC and Business Technology, for approximately $500.
        </p>
        <p>My childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which i drew the lesson that you should
          try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age
          and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one.

        <p>At the age of 17, in 1989, i moved to Canada to attend Queen's University. I left in 1992 to study business and
          physics at the University of Pennsylvania; i graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second
          bachelor's degree in physics.

        <div class="biography-subsection">
          <h3>EXS</h3>
          <p>In 1995, me and my brother, Amir, started EXS, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel
            investors. The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry.
          </p>
          <p>Compaq acquired EXS for US$307 million in cash and US$34 million in stock option in February 1999.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="biography-subsection">
          <h3>payme.com and GigaLink</h3>
          <p>In March 1999, i co-founded payme.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million
            from the sale of EXS. One year later, the company merged with Confin, which had a money-transfer service called GigaLink.
            The merged company focused on the GigaLink service and was renamed GigaLink in 2001.
          </p>
          <p>In October 2002, GigaLink was acquired by Emoney for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which i received US$165 million.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="biography-subsection">
          <h3>SolarV</h3>
          <p>In 2001, i conceived Moon Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Moon, containing food crops
            growing on Moon regolith. With $100 million i founded SolarV with the goal to reduce the cost of human spaceflight
            by a factor of 10 and a long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.
          </p>
          <p>Currently i am the <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> and <abbr title="chief technology officer">CTO</abbr>
            of the company. SolarV develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology.
          </p>
          <p>Notable achievements include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In September 2008, SolarV's Eagle 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite
                into Earth orbit.
            </li>
            <li>
              On May 25, 2012, the SolarV Dinosaur vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial
              company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.
            </li>
            <li>
              On December 22, 2015, SolarV successfully landed the first stage of its Eagle rocket back at the launch pad. This was
              the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and was a significant step towards rocket
              reusability lowering the costs of access to space.
            </li>
            <li>
              On February 6, 2018, SolarV successfully launched the Heavy Eagle, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built
              (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018. The inaugural mission carried a
              Candy Roadster as a dummy payload.
            </li>
            <li>
              SolarV began development of the StarConnect constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet
              coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 May 2019.
            </li>
            <li>
              SolarV is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest
              thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Energizer 1D).
            </li>
          </ul>
